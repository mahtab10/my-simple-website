    <h3>My First Website</h3>
    <p>We had another full ship as we headed down the west coast of Italy. Because of heavy weather we were unable to tender into Amalfi. We have visited the Amalfi Coast several times and it is a remarkably beautiful area. But that is all part of cruising. Sometimes the weather doesn’t cooperate, and it is necessary to enjoy the sea day and just move on to the next port of call. Lipari is one of the Aeolian Islands located near Sicily. It was our first time visiting this picturesque port town which is listed as a UNESCO Heritage Site due to its history and natural beauty. Happily it wasn’t overrun with wandering visitors as we were the only ship in the anchorage. The Cathedral of Saint Bartholomew and the Castello di Lipari are quite interesting as</p>
